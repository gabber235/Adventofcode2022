# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions in Rust

Welcome to my repository where I have made solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) written in the Rust programming language.

Advent of Code is an annual event where a series of programming puzzles are released throughout the month of December. These puzzles are meant to be solved using code, and they often involve a mix of computer science concepts and problem-solving skills.

This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles from Advent of Code 2022. I have written them in Rust, to help my understanding for rust and learn the language.

## Getting Started

To use these solutions, you will need to have the Rust programming language installed on your computer. You can follow the instructions on the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org) to install Rust.

Once you have Rust installed, you can clone this repository to your computer and navigate to the directory where you cloned it. From there, you can run the solutions for each puzzle by running the following command:


```shell
cd day_<x>
cargo run
```
Replace <x> with the day number of the puzzle you want to run. For example, to run the solution for Day 1, you would run the following command:

```shell
cd day_1
cargo run
```
